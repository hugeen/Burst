## Burst

Thanks to [JSPM](http://jspm.io/), it's now possible to use ES6.

So I start refactoring (once again).
For that new start I just want to keep things simple (No overpowered features).

Note : To avoid name collisions with future modules, I now prefix each basic module with "glowing" (In reference to Burst).
